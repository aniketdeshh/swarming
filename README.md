## Swarming (or Active Matter)

This code simulates the swarming of particles (or in real systems, usually a flock of birds).
The program will ask for an interaction radius when run. Choosing a larger radius (numbers usually greater than 3), will mean the birds will travel in few large groups, as the radius is large and most particles will be included. But choosing a small radius will mean only a few birds are in each group and there are large gaps in between flocks.

In real life, this radius could be analagous to a bird's desire to be in large flocks or small ones.
